### 2.2 Commercial Background
The size of the Local ICT market excluding telecom in Bangladesh is estimated to be USD1.54 billion (approx.) [1]. Bangladeshâ€™s export earnings from computer-related services in FY22 is $592 million where  $38 million from computer consultancy services. It also earned $10 million from installation, maintenance, and repair of computers and peripheral equipment services. [2]. 
According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) survey, there are 38.9% internet users in the country. It is also known from the survey of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and ICT Department that currently 89.9% of individuals use mobile phones, of which 30.9% use smartphones. The use of mobile phones at the household level is 52.2%. At the individual level, among 7.4% of computer users, 63.1% of them are not interested in using the internet. 61.8% of them have their own mobile while only 1.4% know programming or coding.[3]. 
By providing a local platform for technical support and services, we can also tap into the potential of the ICT market in Bangladesh and contribute to the growth of the economy. By providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform, we aim to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical individuals and make technology accessible to all. By providing a free space for individuals to find solutions to their technical problems and a platform for helping others, the project will attract a large number of users and tap into paying customers. This will not only benefit individual users but also improve the overall technical knowledge and skills in the country.

### 2.3 Scientific background
In terms of the question answering feature of the platform, it will require knowledge of relevant hardware and software technology, as well as an understanding of troubleshooting techniques, so that the platform can accurately answer questions and provide solutions to users.
Additionally, the project will be implementing a Machine Learning (ML) based solution to provide instant solutions to users' problems. This will require knowledge of ML techniques and algorithms, as well as an understanding of how to train and test ML models. The system will have to understand the problem and provide or suggest a solution based on its learning.
Overall, the Meramot project will require a strong scientific background in computer science, as well as knowledge of relevant hardware and software technology, troubleshooting techniques, and machine learning. This knowledge will be crucial for developing a platform that is robust, reliable, and efficient, and that can provide accurate solutions to users' problems.
